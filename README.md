## Credits
ChatGPT to help me trouble shoot and correct an error with adding multiple objects in an array to the localStorage.
This is the specific code it helped me to generate:
   `let storedData = localStorage.getItem('blogContent');
    let blogContentArry = storedData ? JSON.parse(storedData) : [];

    if (!Array.isArray(blogContentArry)) {
        blogContentArry = [];
    }`
